Passive Voice
<br>
The passive voice in English is a grammatical "voice". 
<br>
The noun or noun phrase that would be the object of a corresponding active sentence (such as "Our troops defeated the enemy") appears as the subject of a sentence or clause in the passive voice ("The enemy was defeated by our troops").
<br>
The subject of a sentence or clause featuring the passive voice typically denotes the recipient of the action (the patient) rather than the performer (the agent). 
<br>
Verbs in the passive voice in English are formed using several parts (periphrastically): the usual construction uses the auxiliary verbs to be or to get together with the past participle of the main verb.
<br>
For example, Caesar was stabbed by Brutus is in the passive voice. 
<br>
The subject, Caesar, indicates the person acted upon. The agent is expressed here with the phrase by Brutus, but this can be omitted. 
<br>
The equivalent sentence in the active voice is Brutus stabbed Caesar, in which the subject denotes the doer, or agent, Brutus. 
<br>
A sentence featuring the passive voice is sometimes called a passive sentence, and a verb phrase in passive voice is sometimes called a passive verb.
<br>
<br>
Prepostitions
<br>
As we've seen, prepositions can tell us where or when something is. However, prepositions are far more versatile than that. The word "preposition" means "positioned before." 
<br>
A preposition sits before a word (either a noun or a pronoun) to show that word's relationship to another nearby word. Look at these examples:
<br>
a bone for the dog
<br>
(Here, the preposition "for" sits before the noun "the dog" to show the relationship between "the dog" and "a bone." 
<br>
This example is not about where or when.)
<br>
everyone except the teacher
<br>
(In this example, the preposition "except" sits before the noun "the teacher" to show the relationship between "the teacher" and "everyone." 
<br>
So, this example is not about where or when either.)

<br>
People and Behaviour
<br>
<br>
When I was a teenager, I was painfully shy (extremely shy). I loved reading books, and I had a vivid imagination (had a creative and colorful imagination). 
<br>
My best friend had a more outgoing personality (she liked to be friendly and sociable) and a good sense of humor (ability to make other people laugh). 
<br>
Unfortunately she was also brutally honest, and sometimes her comments hurt my feelings (made me sad, upset, or angry).
<br>
Although I was fiercely loyal to her, she showed her true colors (revealed her true personality) when she played a prank (did a trick) that humiliated me in front of the class. 
<br>
I bore a grudge (continued feeling angry) against her for years afterwards. Now that I look back on it, I can see that she had low self-esteem (she considered herself inferior) and a bit of a mean streak (a “streak” is a tiny bit of someone’s personality).
<br>
I’ve come out of my shell (become less shy) since those days; I have a thicker skin 
<br>
(I’m less sensitive to criticism) and it doesn’t bother me when people speak their minds (say exactly what they think, without considering the effects of the words on others).
<br>
My biggest flaw is that I have a tendency to be arrogant – some say I have a superiority complex (consider myself superior to others). 
<br>
I’ll admit that it is hard for me to swallow my pride (stop being arrogant) and recognize when I’ve been mistaken about something. 
<br>
My resolution for the New Year is to make a more concerted effort to put others first (consider the needs of other people more important than my own).
